    "Class imbalance in classification problems is a long-standing complication. All data scientists hear about it; many know some off-the-shelf techniques to deal with it; yet it is still a complicated problem, because there are not real one-size-fits-all approaches to tackling imbalanced classification problems.\n",

    "We aim to share a bit of our experience and practices on how to attack this issue. This is a constantly-evolving compilation of techniques that we have employed over the years to address complications that appeared in our daily work as data scientists, especially dealing with the problem of creditworthiness assessment."

    "## “Imbalance” might mean something different from what you think\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the literature, class imbalance refers to situations where the proportion between the two classes is far from 50%, or equivalently, when the proportion of the so-called *positive class* against the rest of the dataset is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we quantify this imbalance via the **prevalance**, denoted by the letter $\\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi \\equiv \\frac{\\mbox{amount of points in the positive class}}{\\mbox{total amount of points}} \\qquad \\mbox{is small}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no consensus on what “far” or “small” mean in the previous sentence: anecdotal experience for the smallness varies across 4 orders of magnitude, from 10% to 0.01%. \n",
    "\n",
    "As pointed out by [1], however, more than the *relative* imbalance between classes, it is perhaps more important – and less common – to look at the *absolute* imbalance, i.e. by how much the total amount of positive samples is smaller than those of the negative class. A dataset A with 10,000 samples of the positive class, out of one million total samples, has a 1% imbalance, yet the difficulty of the problem is evidently different from that of a dataset B, with 1,000 total samples, where 10 are in the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative and absolute imbalance do not imply one another, but they are certainly related. If a large dataset (with length $10^6$, say) has an extreme imbalance ratio (say $10^{-4}$), it is likely that the absolute value of samples in the positive class will be small (in this case, $10^6 \\times 10^{-4} = 100$, which is considered small by most practitioners). Similarly, in industries such as health or pharmacy, in which clinical trials are expensive and not numerous, both the total sample size and the incidence of the positive class are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, imbalanced classification deals with two different, but correlated, issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relative data imbalance**, which affects proportion-based metrics such as training losses and model calibration;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Small data samples**, which affects everything from model performance, estimation of feature importance, to interpretability and feature selection methods."
