    "# Model interpretability: how is it affected by imbalance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerous data science applications, it's important not only to get a correct prediction but also a comprehensive explanation of the inference process. This lends credibility to the model, making us comfortable in its use and ensuring that we are not \"overfitting\" on elements that are not relevant to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different approaches to interpretability. In particular, one of the categorizations is splitting the methods between global explanations and local explanations. At a high level, a local explanation of a model is concerned with describing the reasoning behind a prediction (for example, LIME), while a global explanation attempts to describe the model's behavior in completeness (such as using surrogate models with shallow decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature importances\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based algorithms, during training, naturally build a list of relevant variables. This happens due to their greedy strategy of making the best possible split, with the best possible variable, at any given moment (according to some criterion, usually related to the purity of the created leaves in the case of classification). Poorly discriminating variables are used much less than the variables that help to make the prediction. This process naturally derives measures of importance for variables such as the number of times it is used or a weighting of the information gained during the choice of tree splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As tree-based models empirically tend to perform well, it's usual to analyze the [`.feature_importances`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html) attribute of models to see which variables are relevant to the model we are auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "The current state of the art for model interpretation is [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) (SHapley Additive exPlanations). It is model-agnostic (that is, it can be used with any model), which is very useful and has an elegant high-level understanding. Its main idea is to decompose the final forecast of a given instance into factors associated with each of its variables. To do this, it compares what the forecast would be for that model if a specific variable were not available and sees the delta we get when we add it up. This process is not trivial since the order of withdrawal influences the deltas. Also, it's not obvious what a model that doesn't have a subset of the variables means (should we retrain it?). SHAP has some inferences trying to get around these problems. It works really well and is the most used methodology on the market for explainability today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, SHAP generates, for each instance, a value for each variable so that the sum of these individual contributions is equivalent to the value predicted by the model, that is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x_i) = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^d \\phi_j(x_i), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is our model, $x_i$ is the instance we are trying to understand, $d$ is the number of features, $\\phi_j(x_i)$ is the contribution for feature $j$ for the observation $x_i$, and $\\phi_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i$ is a kind of prior, related to the average of the target in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP is a local explanation algorithm, as should have become clear since we are calculating the prediction contributions of an instance $x_i$, but it allows a global explanation similar to what `.feature_importances_` represents for a tree-based algorithm model: if we group (as the average) the absolute values of the SHAPs of each variable, that is, $\\bar{\\phi_j} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N |\\phi_j(x_i)|$ we get the average contribution per feature. This interpretation allows us to see, on average, what impact a given variable has on decision-making power.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that, usually, for a binary classification problem, the SHAP scale is in log-odds (so if your dataset has a ratio of 0.5-0.5, then $\\phi_0 = 0$). But it is possible, in recent versions of `shap`, to put the SHAP scale in probability.\n",

    "We have seen that the methods of variable importance presented are more impacted with the absolute imbalance than with the relative imbalance, except for the \"purest\" SHAP. This occurred because the variation of $\\phi_0$ as we change the relative imbalance has a significant impact on the values that the SHAPs assume, due to the additive interpretation of their sum being the result of the forecast. It is important to note, however, that despite the values in these cases being on a bad scale, we still have a good ordering that was evidenced by the last use of SHAP, from the simple normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should keep using SHAP importances. It shines when absolute imbalance is not a problem: comparing the `n_samples=20000` example we can see that SHAP importances divides the good features from the bad while the usual feature importance method from sklearn can get confused. You should pay attention to the scale, but as we saw, a simple normalization can solve to problem. Nonetheless, the usual feature importance is decent so if you are concerned with computational time, you don't lose a lot by using it."

    "- Colocar o nome no eixo dos gráficos.\n",

    "- Fica legal calcular cada um dos `.feature_importances_` num classificador diferente, mas fica muito inificiente calcular o SHAP tantas vezes diferentes. Note que o SHAP normalizado é literalmente o mesmo do anterior, mas eu calculei de novo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ficaria mais legal ainda se, mesmo com os `n_samples` diferentes, o dataset fosse \"o mesmo\". Imagino que as curvas ficariam mais parecidas de um `n_samples` pro outro. Da pra fazer isso gerando apenas um `make_classification` grande e fazendo `.sample` dele para os `n_samples` menores.\n",
